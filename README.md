# Probabilistic-neural-network-using-R
This is a classic database often used for analytical projects-iris flowers of three types-setosa, versicolor and virginica are classified on the basis of the following attributes-sepal length and width, petal length and width (in cm). The model evaluated the classes for the given set as well as any new set of values. I used the pnn library of R to build the model and depicted the results on a new dataframe. Using probabilistic neural networking, I evaluated the probability of any given entry or new set of values for belonging to one of the three types. The maximum probability gives the prediction value. Our model could predict 145 of the 150 observations correctly-hence giving a 96.7% performance. You can download the project from drive to get a better look-or connect with me directly.
